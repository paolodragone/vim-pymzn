# vim-pymzn

This is a simple VIM plugin to enable syntax highlighting for MiniZinc (.mzn,
.fzn, .dzn) files and PyMzn (.pmzn) files. <a
href="https://github.com/paolodragone/pymzn">PyMzn</a> files contain a superset
of the MiniZinc language obtained by including Jinja2 templating tags.

This syntax files have been obtained by essentially merging the
<a href="https://github.com/vale1410/vim-minizinc">vim-minizinc</a> and the
<a href="https://github.com/Glench/Vim-Jinja2-Syntax">Vim-Jinja2-Syntax</a>
plugins.
